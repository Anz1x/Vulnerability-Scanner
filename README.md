# Vulnerability-Scanner
A vulnerability scanner made in Python 3.10.2.

NOTE:
You may not get much from this vuln scanner since I only put couple vulnerable banners and only the main ports like port 21, 22 and 80 have a banner but I will prob update this in the future and will add more vulnerable banners. If you know any vulnerable banners then you can just put it in vuln_banners.txt.

Third party modules:

• IPy • Colorama

Installation:

Just clone this repository or download this as a zip
git clone https://github.com/Anz1x/Vulnerability-Scanner

Install the modules IPy and Coloroma if not installed
pip3 install IPy pip3 install Colorama
